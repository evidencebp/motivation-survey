Hello,

About a year ago you answered our survey about motivation in software development.
We are interested in investigating motivation over time.
Since only past participants can help us to compare answers, your answer will be extremely valuable.

We will be thankful if you'll answer about your experience at "${m://ExternalDataReference}", as in the previous time.
If you are no longer active in this project, please answer about a different one.

Answering these questions is estimated to take about 10 minutes of your time.

Three of the participants will receive a 50$ gift card.

Thank you so much for your help in answering  the survey.

Prof. Dror Feitelson, Prof. Avi Kluger,  Ph.D. candidate Idan Amit
