Hello,

We are a team of researchers interested in improving software development.

If you contributed to a GitHub repository as a developer in the last 12 months , we ask for your help by answering questions about your contribution and motivation.

Answering these questions is estimated to take about 10 minutes of your time.

Three of the participants will receive a 50$ gift card.

Thank you so much for your help in answering  the survey.

Prof. Dror Feitelson, Prof. Avi Kluger,  Ph.D. candidate Idan Amit
